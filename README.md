## WeatherWize: 

An application that generates games and activities based on the next five days weather forcast. You can click on each activitiy, that will load further intruction for that specific game.

### Technologies Used

- OpenWeather API and selected the 5 day forcast based on zipcode
- 3 pieces of info from the API
- sticky nav bar
- not quite a tooltip, but a tag to new site
### Approach Taken
### Unsolved Problems
### Improvements For Later
- More complex UI such as a drag and drop or filter list
- Pull more info from the API
